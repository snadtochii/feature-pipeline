# CLAUDE.md — feature-pipeline plugin

Guidance for Claude (and humans) working **on this plugin itself**. For usage of the pipeline, see [README.md](README.md).

This file captures invariants and conventions. Anything derivable from reading the code (file paths, skill names, stage order) stays in the code.

---

## What this repo is

A Claude Code plugin that ships an agentic feature-development pipeline: discovery → analyze → plan → implement → review → test. Each stage is a separate **skill** that can run standalone or be sequenced by the **flow** orchestrator. Stages are backed by specialized **agents** (subagents with focused tool budgets and personas).

The primary audience for edits to this repo is Claude working on the plugin's own skills/agents — not end users. End-user docs live in README.md.

---

## Dev loop

Editing a skill or agent while another Claude Code session is open:

1. Make your edit in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `agents/<name>.md`
2. In the consuming Claude Code session (not this repo — see below), run `/reload-plugins` — the updated skill/agent takes effect without a restart
3. Invoke the skill or trigger the agent to verify the change

**Keep the plugin repo separate from any consuming project** used for testing. Pick a throwaway project (or a real one), create a small ticket via `/feature-pipeline:discovery`, then run `/feature-pipeline:flow <id>`. Running the pipeline against this plugin repo itself creates confusion about which `claudedocs/tickets/` artifacts belong where.

## Pipeline flow (conceptual)

```
discovery → ticket → flow → analyze → plan → implement → review → test → completion
               │                        ↑          ↓         ↓         ↓
               │                        └──────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
               │                             (human-gated loop-backs)
               │
               └→ decompose (optional, for L/XL tickets)
                      │
                      └→ child tickets → each child: flow → analyze → plan → ... → done
```

- **discovery** is step 0 — creates the ticket folder at `claudedocs/tickets/backlog/<id>/` with `01-spec.md` (the ticket itself) and optionally `00-exploration.md`. It is not part of flow.
- **decompose** is step 0b — optional, for L/XL tickets. Runs after analyze, breaks the parent into smaller child tickets that each go through the full pipeline. Not part of flow.
- **flow** orchestrates analyze → plan → implement → review → test with a human review gate after every stage.
- Failures loop backward: review failures re-run `implement`; test failures can re-run either `implement` (code bug) or `plan` (design flaw).

### Runtime source of truth

**Operational details live in `skills/flow/SKILL.md`**, not here. That file is loaded by Claude Code when a consumer runs the pipeline; this `CLAUDE.md` is only loaded when editing the plugin repo itself. If you move operational rules out of the skill and into this file, consumers lose visibility.

Canonical sources in `skills/flow/SKILL.md`:
- **Stage Contract** — reads/writes per stage, re-run inputs
- **Artifact Convention** — numbering rules, reserved prefixes, `.stale/` and `.iterations.json` semantics
- **Loop-back iteration budget** — counter shape, budgets, escalation rules
- **Artifact invalidation** — `.stale/<timestamp>/` policy on deliberate re-runs

Individual stage skills (`skills/<stage>/SKILL.md`) own their own `Required Input` and `Output` sections, which are the authoritative per-stage contracts. flow's Stage Contract table is a consolidated summary of those.

### Dev-side rule

When adding a new input to a stage, document it in the stage's `Required Input` section *and* update flow's Stage Contract table *and* its loop-back path description. All three live in skill files, not in this `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Skill authoring conventions

General Claude Code skill-authoring rules — frontmatter fields and gotchas, trigger-phrase policy, variable substitution, progressive disclosure, body structure, validation errors — live in `~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/references/`. That is the source of truth. Do not duplicate its content here.

This section captures only what's **specific to this plugin** on top of those general rules.

### `allowed-tools` budgets for this plugin's skills

Typical budget per role, expressed as unordered tool sets. The review *skill* may write to `claudedocs/` to save its merged artifact, but its *reviewer agents* are read-only — they must not mutate the tree they review.

| Skill role | Typical budget |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator (flow) | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task, TodoWrite, Skill |
| Analysis/intake stage (discovery, analyze) | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task, TodoWrite |
| Decomposition (decompose) | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, TodoWrite |
| Plan stage | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, TodoWrite (plus plan-mode tools) |
| Implementation stage | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, TodoWrite |
| Review stage | Read, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task, TodoWrite (Write is for the merged `05-review.md` artifact only — no `Edit`, reviewer agents stay read-only) |
| Test stage | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task, TodoWrite + Playwright/Chrome MCP |

If you need a tool not in this table, add it explicitly and document why.

### Frontmatter format — YAML list, always

**This plugin's convention:** all `allowed-tools` (skills) and `tools` (agents) use the **YAML list form**, not the inline string form. One tool per line, 2-space indent under the field:

```yaml
# Skills
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Glob

# Agents
tools:
  - Read
  - Glob
  - Grep
```

**Why:** skill `allowed-tools` is space-separated and agent `tools` is comma-separated in their inline string forms — opposite separators in two fields that do the same thing. Using the wrong separator silently fails (one malformed tool name, no error raised). The YAML list form works unambiguously for both and eliminates the asymmetry at the source. All 14 skills and agents in this plugin use it; if you're adding a new one, match the convention.

### Shared references

When a block would otherwise be duplicated across multiple stage skills, extract it. The canonical example is `skills/flow/references/ticket-resolution.md`, referenced from every stage skill that resolves a ticket argument.

---

## Agent authoring conventions

General Claude Code agent-authoring rules — frontmatter fields, `tools:` comma-separated format, description policy, optional fields (`permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `hooks`), body template options — live in `~/.claude/skills/skill-creator/references/agent-frontmatter.md`. That is the source of truth. Do not duplicate its content here.

Agents in this plugin live at `agents/*.md` and are loaded as subagent types namespaced `feature-pipeline:<agent-name>`. This section captures only what's **specific to this plugin**.

### Tool budgets for this plugin's agents

| Agent role | Tools | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Explorer (`code-explorer`) | Read-only set + Serena semantic tools | Describe, don't mutate; Serena adds symbol-level leverage |
| Analyst (`requirements-analyst`) | Read-only set | Describe, don't mutate; purely spec/analysis work — no codebase navigation |
| Reviewer (`code-reviewer`, `security-engineer`, `performance-engineer`) | Read-only set | Reviews must not mutate the tree; work on diffs, not codebase navigation |
| Architect (`code-architect`, in both review and blueprint modes) | Read-only set + Serena semantic tools | Pattern comparison across sibling code is this agent's core work |
| UI tester (`ui-tester`) | Read set + Playwright/Chrome MCP | Browser testing, no code mutation |

**Read-only set:** `Glob, Grep, LS, Read, NotebookRead, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch`. (`KillShell` and `BashOutput` are deliberately excluded — they only make sense paired with `Bash`, which read-only agents don't have.)

**Serena semantic tools** (optional enhancement — additive, agents fall back to Grep/Glob/Read when Serena MCP is unavailable): `mcp__serena__find_symbol`, `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols`, `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview`. Added to agents whose core work is symbol-level navigation or cross-file pattern recognition. Not added to reviewers — they work on diffs, not codebase navigation, and the tools would be noise.

### Model: opus for every agent in this plugin

Every agent pins `model: opus` rather than inheriting. Rationale: the pipeline is for personal projects where per-run velocity and reasoning quality matter more than throughput cost. Reviewers, architects, explorers, and analysts all benefit from deeper reasoning on per-ticket work where volume is low. Exception: if a future agent does purely mechanical work where Opus's reasoning is wasted, `sonnet` or `haiku` are acceptable — none currently qualify.

### Body template: Template B

Every agent in this plugin uses Template B (Triggers / Behavioral Mindset / Focus Areas / Key Actions / Outputs / Boundaries) — see `agent-frontmatter.md` for the template itself. This plugin does not use Template A. Rationale: matches the user's personal-agent standard in `~/.claude/agents/`, SuperClaude alignment, and the explicit `Triggers` body section reinforces delegation accuracy for parallel-review scenarios.

### No implementer agent

The implement stage runs in main context (see "Main-context vs subagent" below); implementation tool access is governed by the `implement` skill's `allowed-tools`, not by an agent tool budget. There is intentionally no `implementer.md` in `agents/`.

---

## Main-context vs subagent — which runs where

Not every stage runs as a subagent. The rule:

| Runs in main context | Runs as subagent |
|---|---|
| `flow` (orchestrator) | Analysis/review work |
| `discovery` (interactive dialogue) | Parallel/isolated tasks |
| `plan` (uses `EnterPlanMode`, needs user interaction) | Contexts that should fork |
| `implement` (long interactive coding + validation) | — |

**Rule:** run in main context only when you need *interactivity* or *plan mode*. Otherwise prefer a subagent — it keeps the main context clean.

The `implement` skill folds its behavioral guidelines (mindset, focus areas, boundaries) directly into the SKILL.md body rather than delegating to a subagent — this is intentional, since the stage needs main-context interactivity for iterative coding + validation. See `skills/implement/SKILL.md` for the canonical implementer mindset.

---

## Ticket resolution (shared across skills)

Every stage skill resolves a ticket argument identically. Canonical logic lives in **`skills/flow/references/ticket-resolution.md`** and is referenced from `flow`, `analyze`, `plan`, `implement`, `review`, and `test`. `discovery` handles the intake/creation variant inline (prefix logic lives there).

**Do not duplicate the resolution logic inline** in a stage skill — link to the reference. If the resolution rules change, update the reference once.

Quick summary (full version in the reference):
- Path-like argument → read directly (folder path or `01-spec.md` path inside the folder)
- ID argument → search `backlog/`, `in-progress/`, `done/`, then glob across `claudedocs/tickets/**/<id>/`
- Not found → ask the user
- Resolves to the ticket folder `claudedocs/tickets/<state>/<id>/` containing `01-spec.md` (the ticket) and all stage artifacts

---

## Ticket format

Tickets are markdown with YAML frontmatter — see `skills/discovery/TEMPLATE.md` for the canonical schema.

- **Prefix** per project (`BL` for big-leaves, `SY` for symphony). Stored as the `prefix` field in `claudedocs/tickets/config.yaml`. Discovery creates the file on first run and infers from existing tickets if it's missing. `config.yaml` is the canonical home for tickets-system configuration — future fields (status flow customization, complexity scale, etc.) go here, not in new dotfiles.
- **ID format:** `<PREFIX>-<N>` — no leading zeros.
- **Filename:** `<PREFIX>-<N>-<slug>.md`
- **Status flow:** `backlog → in-progress → done` (folders match). Cancellation is expressed via frontmatter `status: cancelled` inside `done/`, not a separate folder.
- Ticket *folders* move between state folders as the pipeline advances — the entire folder (spec, artifacts, `bugs/`, `.iterations.json`, `.stale/`) moves as a unit. `flow` moves `backlog → in-progress` at setup; completion moves `in-progress → done` and updates the `status` frontmatter field.
- **Parent/child relationships** (optional, used by `decompose`):
  - `parent: <id>` — links a child ticket to its epic/parent. Added by decompose.
  - `children: [<id>, ...]` — lists child ticket IDs on the parent. Added by decompose.
  - Both fields are optional. Tickets without them are standalone (the common case for S/M tickets).

## Adding a new stage

1. Create `skills/<stage>/SKILL.md` following the skill body template above
2. Reserve the next artifact number (`08-*.md`) — update the "Artifact Convention" section in `skills/flow/SKILL.md`
3. Add stage to flow's pipeline order, stage list, and flag handling (`--from`, `--to`, `--only`, `--skip`)
4. Add `--continue` detection: when to resume from this stage
5. Document the stage's input/output contract in the stage's `Required Input`/`Output` sections *and* in flow's Stage Contract table
6. If the new stage introduces a loop-back, add a counter to `.iterations.json` and wire it into the loop-back iteration budget section of `skills/flow/SKILL.md`
7. Update `skills/flow/SKILL.md`'s Artifact invalidation downstream table for the new stage
8. If the stage spawns subagents, create them in `agents/` and wire them up

## Adding a new agent

1. Create `agents/<name>.md` using the canonical body template
2. Set `tools` explicitly based on the tool budget table
3. Set `model` — default to `opus`
4. Reference the agent from a skill (otherwise it's dead weight — unused agents shouldn't ship)

---

## Validation expectations

Before committing changes to skills or agents:

1. **Lint the frontmatter** — no angle brackets, no markdown in descriptions, valid YAML
2. **Check tool budget** against the table above — reviewers must not have write access
3. **Check trigger phrases** — every skill description must include natural trigger phrases
4. **Run the skill-creator review mode** on the changed skill: `/skill-creator <name> --review`
5. **Walk the stage contract in `skills/flow/SKILL.md`** — if you changed inputs/outputs, update the Stage Contract table *and* every consuming stage's `Required Input` section

There's no automated test suite for the plugin itself. Validation is by skill-creator review + manual pipeline runs on real tickets.

---

## Commit discipline

- No marketing language in commit messages ("magnificent", "blazingly fast", etc.)
- Reference the issue/feature the commit addresses
- Keep commits small — one concern per commit
- Never commit `.DS_Store` (already in `.gitignore`)

---

## Considered and deferred

Decisions made during the current conventions pass that were evaluated and explicitly *not* adopted. Kept here so future maintenance has context on why the code looks the way it does.

- **Design-match reviewer as 5th parallel reviewer** in the `review` stage. Deferred because it assumes design artifacts (Figma, wireframes) that not every personal-project ticket has. Reconsider when a ticket workflow routinely includes design references.
- **Legacy `meta.md` + `description.md` + `images/` layout** (from the user's production `jira-describe`/`describe`/`prepare` flow). Not adopted: frontmatter on `01-spec.md` already carries metadata, so a separate `meta.md` would be a redundant file. `images/` could be added inside the ticket folder if image handling becomes a need — defer until then.
- **Code-explorer output caching** across discovery, analyze, and plan stages. Current flow runs `code-explorer` twice (once in discovery, once in analyze), which is a real inefficiency — but the fix is structural (shared memory layer or explicit artifact reuse) and worth its own pass.
- **Step-type routing** in plan/implement (`figma-ui`, `component`, `service`, etc.) — valuable in the user's production flow but too project-specific to generalize. Plan skill now annotates step content explicitly instead.
- **PR-workflow integration** with the user's `code-review` and `address-review` skills. Those skills assume GitHub + `gh` CLI; feature-pipeline is general-purpose. Users working on GitHub projects can pair feature-pipeline with those separate skills without embedding the dependency.
